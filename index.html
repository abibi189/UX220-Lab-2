<p>
    I recently read a novel called "I Went to Another World" or "Inso Law"; this piece has a comic version and a writing verse. This novel was fascinating because of the structure of the main character, who was put into another world after she slept. She was living an everyday life, starting her first year in high school, but everything changed the next day. Her parents were the same as usual, but the school she was about to go to had disappeared. She woke up and saw her uniform hanging behind the door, but the uniform was completely altered.

    She asked her parents; her mother was confused about what she was saying. Then she tried to look it up on her phone and even went to the school area, but it was nowhere to be seen. The main character realizes she's in another "multiverse" that has another version of her parents but inside a novel. From there, she tries to live like an average person and try to see what will happen in the future.
